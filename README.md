OandaWrap
=========

Php interface for Oanda API.

A note
=========
I wrote this code a long time ago. If you're seriously considering writing an Oanda PHP interface, I'd recommend using NodeJs or Python instead.

This should be fully functional, but for the v1 of Oandas API, v2 is not supported.

Documentation
=========

Please see the link at the top of the page for the downloadable HTML manual.

Examples can be found in the example folder.

The project OandaWrap has come about due to my work on other projects and the need for a solid base of operations. I hope you will find that the wrapper is functional and stable. However if you do happen to find a bug, please shoot me a quick mail and I'll be glad to help you out.

If you're looking for a class based version of OandaWrap, instead of static, please check out https://github.com/neilmillard/OandaWrap/tree/class

Best regards,

Will
